## Whether

A project that displays whether the weather is good in 5 different cities! Includes a homepage with an overview of all cities and more details + a 5 day forecast when selecting a city. Also, whether the weather is good!

I chose to code the site in React because of frequent re-rendering and data changes, and I chose to use local storage so that a user can use the app without signing in and their changes will persist.

### Upcoming Features:

  - User preferences! If someone likes snow or thunderstorms, their verdicts will be tailored to their preferences
  - More verdicts! I'd like a wider array of messages to fit the many types of weather
  - 404 page! To cover the case of going to a details/:placeId page without having that city on your local storage
  - Will look into using Jest as a testing framework too (cuz tests are important ~)

Enjoy!
