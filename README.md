## Whether

A project that displays whether the weather is good in 5 different cities! Includes a homepage with an overview of all cities and more details + a 5 day forecast when selecting a city. Also, whether the weather is good!

I chose to code the site in React because of frequent re-rendering and data changes, and I chose to use local storage so that a user can use the app without signing in and their changes will persist.

Thinking of also adding user preferences, so if someone likes snow or thunderstorms, their verdicts will be tailored to their preferences.

Also, going to make the list able to hold more than 5 cities, maybe 10-15?

Enjoy!
