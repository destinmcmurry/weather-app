## Weather App

A project that displays the weather in 5 different cities! Includes a homepage with an overview of all cities and more details + a 5 day forecast when selecting a city. 

I chose to code the site in React because of frequent re-rendering based on data changes. I chose to use local storage so that a user can use the app without signing in and their changes will persist.

(not a huge fan of these icons, but much easier than using a list not associated with the API)

Enjoy!
